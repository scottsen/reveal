## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- **JavaScript analyzer** (.js) - Full ES6+ support via tree-sitter
  - Extracts function declarations, arrow functions, classes
  - Supports import/export statements
  - Handles async functions and object methods
  - Cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS)

- **TypeScript analyzer** (.ts, .tsx) - Full TypeScript support via tree-sitter
  - Extracts functions with type annotations
  - Supports class definitions and interfaces
  - React/TSX component support (.tsx files)
  - Type definitions and return types
  - Cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS)

- **Bash/Shell script analyzer** (.sh, .bash) - DevOps script support via tree-sitter
  - Extracts function definitions (both `function name()` and `name()` syntax)
  - Cross-platform analysis (parses bash syntax on any OS)
  - Does NOT execute scripts, only analyzes syntax
  - Works with WSL, Git Bash, and native Unix shells
  - Custom `_get_function_name()` implementation for bash 'word' node types

- **12 comprehensive tests** in `test_new_analyzers.py`:
  - JavaScript: functions, classes, imports, UTF-8 handling
  - TypeScript: typed functions, classes, interfaces, TSX/React components
  - Bash: function extraction, complex scripts, cross-platform compatibility
  - Cross-platform UTF-8 validation for all three analyzers

### Changed
- **File type count: 10 → 15** supported file types
  - JavaScript (.js)
  - TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) - 2 extensions
  - Bash (.sh, .bash) - 2 extensions

- **Updated analyzers/__init__.py** to register new analyzers
- **Fixed test_main_cli.py** version assertion to use regex pattern instead of hardcoded version

### Technical Details

**JavaScript Support:**
- Tree-sitter language: `javascript`
- Node types: function_declaration, class_declaration, import_statement
- Handles modern ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, classes, modules)

**TypeScript Support:**
- Tree-sitter language: `typescript`
- Supports both .ts and .tsx (React) files
- Extracts type annotations and interfaces
- Handles generic types and complex TypeScript features

**Bash Support:**
- Tree-sitter language: `bash`
- Custom implementation: Bash uses `word` for function names, not `identifier`
- Overrides `_get_function_name()` to handle bash-specific AST structure
- Supports both `function deploy() {}` and `deploy() {}` syntaxes

**Cross-Platform Strategy:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Universal web languages, native cross-platform support
- Bash: Analyzes syntax only (doesn't execute), works on Windows via WSL/Git Bash
- All analyzers tested on UTF-8 content with emoji and multi-byte characters

**Real-World Validation:**
- Tested on SDMS platform codebase
- JavaScript: Extracted classes from pack-builder.js files
- Bash: Extracted 5+ functions from deploy-container.sh
- All UTF-8 characters (emoji, special symbols) handled correctly

### Windows Compatibility
All new analyzers are fully Windows-compatible:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Native cross-platform support
- **Bash:** Syntax analysis works on Windows (common in Git Bash, WSL, Docker workflows)
- No execution required, only parsing

**Future Windows Support:**
- PowerShell (.ps1) - Not yet available in tree-sitter-languages
- Batch files (.bat, .cmd) - Not yet available in tree-sitter-languages

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: TreeSitter UTF-8 byte offset handling** - Fixed function/class/import name truncation bug
  - GitHub Issues #6, #7, #8: Function names, class names, and import statements were truncated or corrupted
  - Root cause: Tree-sitter uses byte offsets but we were slicing Unicode strings
  - Multi-byte UTF-8 characters (emoji, non-Latin scripts) caused byte/character offset mismatch
  - Solution: Convert to bytes for slicing, then decode back to string
  - Affected all tree-sitter languages (Python, Rust, Go, GDScript, etc.)
  - Fixed in `reveal/treesitter.py:_get_node_text()`
- **Test assertion:** Updated version test to expect 0.4.0 (was incorrectly testing for 0.3.0)

### Added
- **4 comprehensive UTF-8 regression tests** in `test_treesitter_utf8.py`:
  - Test function names with emoji in docstrings
  - Test class names with multi-byte characters
  - Test imports with Unicode strings
  - Test complex Unicode throughout file (multiple languages, extensive emoji)
- Extensive code comments explaining UTF-8 byte offset handling

### Technical Details
**Bug reproduction:**
- Files with multi-byte UTF-8 characters before function/class/import definitions
- Tree-sitter returns byte offset 100, but string character offset is 97 (if 3-byte emoji present)
- Slicing `string[100:]` starts too far, losing first few characters

**Examples of bugs fixed:**
- ❌ Before: `test_function_name` → `st_function_name` (missing "te")
- ✅ After: `test_function_name` (complete)
- ❌ Before: `import numpy as np` → `rt numpy as np\nimp` (garbled)
- ✅ After: `import numpy as np` (clean)
- ❌ Before: `TestClassName` → `tClassName` (truncated)
- ✅ After: `TestClassName` (complete)

**Impact:**
- All tree-sitter-based analyzers now handle Unicode correctly
- Python, Rust, Go, GDScript all benefit from this fix
- Particularly important for codebases with emoji in docstrings or non-Latin comments
